## Installation

### Prerequisites

- [Cursor IDE](https://cursor.sh/)
- Node.js 16+
- Linear account (for Linear integration)

### Option 1: Install From npm (Recommended)

The package is available on npm and can be installed globally:

```bash
npm install -g mo-linear-mcp
```

You can also use it directly without installation via npx:

```bash
npx mo-linear-mcp
```

Visit the package on npm: [mo-linear-mcp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mo-linear-mcp)

### Option 2: Local Development Setup

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mo-linear-mcp.git
   cd mo-linear-mcp
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Build the project:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

4. Run in development mode:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Cursor MCP Configuration

To use Mo in Cursor, you need to configure it in the MCP settings. Here's an example configuration:

```json
{
  "version": "0.1",
  "mcps": {
    "mo-linear-mcp-dev": {
      "name": "Mo Linear MCP (Dev)",
      "description": "Linear Task Management for Cursor IDE - Development Mode",
      "command": "npm",
      "args": ["run", "dev"],
      "cwd": "/path/to/your/mo-linear-mcp",
      "enabled": true
    },
    "linear": {
      "name": "Linear",
      "description": "Linear Task Management for Cursor",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mo-linear-mcp"],
      "enabled": true
    }
  }
}
```

To access the MCP configuration in Cursor:

1. Open Cursor IDE
2. Go to Settings â†’ Extensions â†’ MCP Servers
3. Click "Edit MCP Config" and paste the configuration above
4. Adjust the "cwd" path to match your local repository path (for development mode)

## Development and Publishing

### Local Development

For rapid development and testing:

```bash
# Watch for changes
npm run watch

# In another terminal, test commands
echo '{"command": "/mo linear-status"}' | npm run dev
```

### Publishing Updates

To publish a new version to npm:

```bash
# Bump the version (patch, minor, or major)
npm version patch   # For small fixes
npm version minor   # For new features
npm version major   # For breaking changes

# Build and publish
npm run build
npm publish
```

- `/mo task-details` - View task details
- `/mo delete-task` - Delete a task
- `/mo help` - Show help information
- `/mo settings` - View/update settings

**Linear Commands**

- `/mo linear-auth` - Authenticate with Linear API
- `/mo linear-status` - Check Linear authentication status
- `/mo linear-logout` - Log out from Linear API
- `/mo linear-teams` - List Linear teams
- `/mo linear-projects` - List Linear projects
