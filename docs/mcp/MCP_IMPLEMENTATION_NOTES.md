# MCP Implementation Notes for Linear Integration

## Overview

This document summarizes the changes made to ensure our Linear integration properly follows the Model Context Protocol (MCP) best practices and guidelines.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Command Registration

The Linear commands are registered with the MCP system via the `getLinearCommands()` function in `src/linear/commands/register.ts`. The function returns a map of command names to `CommandRegistration` objects that are then integrated into the application's command registry in `src/commands/index.ts`.

### 2. Interactive Responses

All Linear command handlers were updated to include `actionButtons` in their response objects. These interactive buttons provide a more user-friendly experience and allow users to easily navigate between related commands without needing to remember command syntax.

Example:

```typescript
return {
  success: true,
  message: "Found Linear teams",
  markdown: formatTeams(teams),
  actionButtons: [
    {
      label: "View Projects",
      command: `/mo linear-projects team:${teamId}`,
    },
    {
      label: "View Issues",
      command: `/mo linear-issues team:${teamId}`,
    },
  ],
};
```

### 3. Resource Definitions

The Linear integration exposes several resources to the MCP system, which are documented in `docs/mcp/LINEAR_MCP_INTEGRATION.md`:

- `linearUser`: Current authenticated Linear user
- `linearTeam`: Linear team information
- `linearIssue`: Linear issue details
- `linearProject`: Linear project information
- `linearState`: Linear workflow state

### 4. Error Handling

All command handlers implement consistent error handling with clear error messages and suggested actions:

```typescript
return {
  success: false,
  message: "Failed to get Linear teams",
  error: error.message,
  markdown: `### Error\n\nFailed to get Linear teams: ${error.message}`,
  actionButtons: [
    {
      label: "Check Status",
      command: "/mo linear-status",
    },
    {
      label: "Try Again",
      command: "/mo linear-teams",
    },
  ],
};
```

### 5. Documentation

Added comprehensive documentation to support the MCP integration:

- `docs/mcp/LINEAR_MCP_INTEGRATION.md`: Describes the integration with MCP
- `src/linear/commands/README.md`: Documents the command handlers implementation
- Extensive JSDoc comments throughout the code

## Future Improvements

1. Add unit tests for all command handlers
2. Implement the MCP Inspector tool integration for testing
3. Add support for webhooks to receive real-time updates from Linear
4. Implement more sophisticated conflict resolution mechanisms
5. Add support for Linear attachments and comments
