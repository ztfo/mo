# Mo - Task Management MCP Server for Cursor

## Project Overview

Mo is a task management tool designed as a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for Cursor IDE. It provides seamless integration with Linear for issue tracking and task management, allowing developers to manage their workflow directly from within Cursor.

## Key Goals

1. **Simplify Task Management**: Provide an intuitive interface for creating, tracking, and managing tasks
2. **Linear Integration**: Seamless synchronization with Linear for team-based project management
3. **Context-Aware**: Leverage Cursor's context to create tasks related to the current code or project
4. **AI-Enhanced**: Use AI capabilities to generate tasks, offer suggestions, and improve workflow

## MCP Approach

By building Mo as an MCP server for Cursor (instead of a traditional extension), we can:

- Leverage Cursor's existing AI capabilities
- Simplify the development and maintenance process
- Focus on core functionality without complex UI development
- Provide a command-based interface that's familiar to Cursor users

## Project Phases

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Current)

- Set up MCP server structure
- Implement basic task management functionality
- Create local storage solution
- Establish command patterns

### Phase 2: Linear Integration

- Implement Linear API connectivity
- Add authentication flow
- Enable bidirectional sync with Linear
- Support filtering and querying issues

### Phase 3: AI Enhancement

- Task generation from project context
- Smart task organization suggestions
- Automated priority assignment
- Project planning assistance

### Phase 4: Advanced Features

- Advanced filtering and search
- Custom workflows and templates
- Reporting and visualization
- Team collaboration features

## Timeline

- Phase 1: 2 weeks
- Phase 2: 2 weeks
- Phase 3: 2 weeks
- Phase 4: 2 weeks

## Success Metrics

- Reduced context switching between Cursor and task management tools
- Improved task tracking accuracy
- Faster task creation and management
- Seamless synchronization with Linear
