# Mo - Task Management MCP Server for Cursor

## Project Overview

Mo is a task management tool designed as a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for Cursor IDE. It provides seamless integration with Linear for issue tracking and task management, allowing developers to manage their workflow directly from within Cursor.

## Key Goals

1. **Simplify Task Management**: Provide an intuitive interface for creating, tracking, and managing tasks
2. **Linear Integration**: Seamless synchronization with Linear for team-based project management
3. **Context-Aware**: Leverage Cursor's context to create tasks related to the current code or project
4. **AI-Enhanced**: Use AI capabilities to generate tasks, offer suggestions, and improve workflow

## MCP Approach

By building Mo as an MCP server for Cursor (instead of a traditional extension), we can:

- Leverage Cursor's existing AI capabilities
- Simplify the development and maintenance process
- Focus on core functionality without complex UI development
- Provide a command-based interface that's familiar to Cursor users
- **Utilize editor context for richer task creation and management**
- **Support MCP protocol version compatibility**

## Project Phases

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Current)

- Set up MCP server structure
- Implement basic task management functionality
- Create local storage solution
- Establish command patterns
- **Implement protocol version detection and handling**
- **Add robust error handling and response formatting**
- **Enhance context utilization in task management**

### Phase 2: Linear Integration

- Implement Linear API connectivity
- Add authentication flow with secure credential storage
- Enable bidirectional sync with Linear
- Support filtering and querying issues
- **Add rate limiting and pagination for API efficiency**
- **Implement conflict resolution for synchronization**
- **Create error recovery mechanisms for API failures**

### Phase 3: AI Enhancement

- Task generation from project context
- Smart task organization suggestions
- Automated priority assignment
- Project planning assistance
- **Leverage code context for intelligent task suggestions**
- **Implement rich markdown responses with actionable links**
- **Add task relationship detection and management**

### Phase 4: Advanced Features

- Advanced filtering and search
- Custom workflows and templates
- Reporting and visualization
- Team collaboration features
- **Add interactive command responses**
- **Implement workspace-aware task organization**
- **Create data export/import capabilities**

## Timeline

- Phase 1: 2-3 weeks (extended for protocol handling and context utilization)
- Phase 2: 2-3 weeks
- Phase 3: 2-3 weeks
- Phase 4: 2-3 weeks

## Implementation Priorities

1. **Protocol Compatibility**: Ensure compatibility with Cursor's MCP implementation
2. **Context Utilization**: Maximize the use of editor context in task management
3. **Command Response Quality**: Provide rich, actionable responses to commands
4. **Data Security**: Implement secure storage, especially for credentials
5. **Testing Infrastructure**: Create comprehensive testing for reliability

## Success Metrics

- Reduced context switching between Cursor and task management tools
- Improved task tracking accuracy
- Faster task creation and management
- Seamless synchronization with Linear
- **High quality, context-aware task metadata**
- **Reliable operation across Cursor versions**
