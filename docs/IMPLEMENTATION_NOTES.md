# Mo Plugin - Implementation Notes

## Overview

This document provides detailed notes on the implementation work done so far, the technical decisions made, and the strategy for ongoing development of the Mo Plugin.

## Recent Implementation Work

### 1. Planning Interface with AI Integration

We've enhanced the Planning Interface to integrate with Cursor's AI capabilities for task generation:

- **AI-Powered Task Generation**: The planning interface now connects to Cursor's AI API to generate detailed tasks based on project descriptions.
- **Configurable Generation Options**: Users can now set detail level, focus areas, and tech stack information to guide task generation.
- **Graceful Fallback Mechanism**: The system falls back to mock implementation if AI capabilities are not available.
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for AI responses, with user-friendly feedback.
- **Structured Output Processing**: AI responses are parsed and validated to ensure they match the required task structure.

Key technical decisions:
- Using direct Cursor AI API access through context passed from the extension entry point
- Structured JSON output format for consistent parsing
- Template-based prompt generation for better AI guidance

### 2. Export Dialog & Enhanced Export Functionality

We've implemented a comprehensive export system for tasks:

- **Interactive Export Dialog**: A full-featured webview for configuring exports.
- **Task Selection**: Users can select specific tasks to export.
- **Directory Organization Options**: Multiple organization structures (flat, by status, by priority, by project).
- **Template System**: Support for multiple templates (default, minimal, detailed).
- **Section Customization**: Users can choose which sections to include in exports.
- **File Naming Options**: Configurable file naming patterns.
- **Live Preview**: Real-time preview of exports and directory structures.

Key technical decisions:
- Using webview for rich UI experience rather than simple dialogs
- Client-side task filtering and organization for responsiveness
- Templating system for flexible content generation
- Directory structure visualization for better user experience

## Development Strategy

### Short-Term Focus (Next Sprint)

1. **Task Sidebar Enhancements**:
   - Implement advanced filtering capabilities
   - Add task status update controls directly in the sidebar
   - Implement quick copy-to-clipboard functionality for task contexts

2. **Linear Integration Improvements**:
   - Implement team and project selection in UI
   - Add label and cycle assignment
   - Support for assignee selection
   - Implement bulk operations for tasks

3. **UI Polish**:
   - Fix any existing linter errors and UI glitches
   - Improve responsiveness and loading states
   - Add proper error handling for all API calls

### Medium-Term Goals (Next 2-3 Sprints)

1. **Status Bar Integration**:
   - Implement task count indicator
   - Add sync status indicator
   - Create quick access to task view

2. **Two-Way Sync with Linear**:
   - Implement change tracking for tasks
   - Add conflict resolution for concurrent updates
   - Create background sync mechanism

3. **Documentation**:
   - Create comprehensive user guide
   - Document API for extension developers
   - Add setup and installation instructions

### Long-Term Vision

1. **Code Integration**:
   - Implement code-to-task linking
   - Add task-specific code generation
   - Create automatic context gathering from code

2. **Advanced Linear Integration**:
   - Full projects and cycles integration
   - Advanced reporting and metrics
   - Timeline visualization

3. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Implement caching strategies for API calls
   - Optimize rendering for large task sets
   - Add pagination for better performance

## Technical Design Decisions

### 1. Modular Architecture

We've structured the codebase with a modular approach:
- Each major feature has its own file with clear separation of concerns
- UI components are isolated in the webviews directory
- API logic is separated from UI logic

### 2. Progressive Enhancement

The plugin follows a progressive enhancement approach:
- Basic functionality works without AI integration
- Enhanced features are available when AI capabilities exist
- Graceful fallbacks for all advanced features

### 3. Error Handling Strategy

We've implemented a comprehensive error handling approach:
- Clear error messages in the UI
- Detailed error logging for debugging
- Graceful degradation when services are unavailable

### 4. UI/UX Principles

Our UI implementation follows these principles:
- Consistent with VS Code/Cursor design patterns
- Responsive and accessible
- Clear feedback for all user actions
- Progressive disclosure of complex options

## Known Issues and Limitations

1. **Cursor API Limitations**:
   - Limited information about the current API capabilities
   - Inconsistent behavior between VS Code and Cursor APIs
   - Some UI components not fully supported

2. **Linear API Constraints**:
   - Rate limiting for frequent API calls
   - Limited bulk operation support
   - Pagination required for large datasets

3. **UI Framework Limitations**:
   - Limited styling options in webviews
   - No direct access to VS Code theming
   - Performance issues with large data sets

## Next Steps

1. Complete task sidebar enhancements for better task management
2. Implement team and project selection in Planning Interface
3. Add copy context functionality to make task details more accessible
4. Begin status bar integration for quick access
5. Start documentation efforts for user guidance
