4. ✅ Improve the task sidebar with enhanced filtering and interaction options

### Phase 2

1. Add the status bar integration for quick access
2. Implement two-way sync with Linear
3. Enhance the UI components with better visuals and interactions
4. Create comprehensive documentation

### Phase 3

1. Add advanced filtering and search
2. Implement code-to-task linking
3. Add data visualization for project metrics
4. Implement notifications system

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Complete the task sidebar improvements with enhanced filtering and search
2. Implement the team and project selection in the Planning Interface
3. Add copy to clipboard functionality for task contexts
4. Create status bar integration for quick access
5. Begin comprehensive documentation

## Technical Debt

2. Refactor the UI framework for better maintainability
3. Add comprehensive testing
4. Implement proper TypeScript types throughout the codebase
5. Optimize performance for larger projects
6. ✅ Fix TypeScript build errors in template literals

## Current Build Status (UPDATED)

The project has been fully restored and is now using proper TypeScript compilation!

### Progress on Error Fixes

We've successfully fixed all TypeScript errors in the project:

1. ✅ Fixed template literals in export-dialog.ts

   - generateDefaultTemplate function
   - generateMinimalTemplate function
   - generateDetailedTemplate function
   - updateDirectoryStructure function
   - getFileName function
   - exportTasks function

2. ✅ Added missing dependencies

   - node-fetch
   - dotenv
   - @types/node-fetch
   - @types/node

3. ✅ Restored proper TypeScript compilation
   - Created a build.js script that uses TypeScript compiler
   - Fallback to simplified build only if TypeScript compilation fails
   - Updated development scripts for better developer experience

### Next Steps

1. ✅ Fix the TypeScript template literal errors in the export-dialog.ts file
2. ✅ Fix remaining TypeScript errors in other files
3. ✅ Restore the full TypeScript compilation process
4. ✅ Implement enhanced task sidebar with filtering and search
5. Continue implementing the planned features as outlined in the Implementation Plan
